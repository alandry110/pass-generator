//Figure out what the starting code does.
//Define the generate password function. Use console.log to make sure things are connecting. 

//Pseudocode Steps to Begin:
//Step 1: Create arrays of all characters & symbols.
//Step 2: prompt the user for the pass criteria. 
//        a. Password length between 8- 128
//        b. prompt the user for lowercase, uppercase, numeric or special characters.
//Step 3: validate the input (using if or do while)
//Step 4: generate password using prompts
//Step 5: display generated pass on page.
