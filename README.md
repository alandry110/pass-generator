# JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator 

## About the Repository
This client has access to sensitive data and would like for me to create a password generator that uses a series of prompts that leads to a strong password that will provide the client with greater security. 

## User Story 
```md

## Description and Credits 

To make my JavaScript meet the acceptance criteria, I sought help from multiple resources, which include:

* w3schools: I used w3schools to help me understand loops and conditions better.
* YouTube by Paul Keldsen - Web Development(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4HUaiazDes&start=160): This video helped me understand the importance of Pseudocoding and help me grasped where to begin. 
* MDN Links from the JavaScript mini project:
