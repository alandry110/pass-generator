## Additional instruction to complete the final challenge included:
* Application deploys at live URL with no loading errors 
* Should not produce any errors in the console when you inspect it using Chrome DevTools.
* Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate
* Application user interface style is clean and polished
* Application resembles the mock-up functionality in acceptance criteria 
* Repository as a unique name, has proper file structure, contains multiple descriptive commit messages, and a quality README file with description, screenshot of the final project, and a link to the live deployed application

## Description and Credits 

To make my JavaScript meet the acceptance criteria, I sought help from multiple resources, which include:

* w3schools: I used w3schools to help me understand loops and conditions better.
* YouTube by Paul Keldsen - Web Development(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4HUaiazDes&start=160): This video helped me understand the importance of Pseudocoding and help me grasped where to begin. 
* MDN Links from the JavaScript mini project:
